    <p>Last month i used someone&#39;s Minecraft Skin to use it as my own skin which is funny but kinda silly for me, then i have an idea!</p>
    <p>&quot;What if i merge Maid Outfit base to my Serial Designation N skin?&quot;</p>
    <p><strong>That was i am gonna do.</strong></p>
    <p>So i download <a href="https://www.blockbench.net/">Blockbench</a> which is a tool that i can use for making a model or animate and create a skin which using this <a href="https://www.minecraftskins.com/skin/21145587/maid-steve/">Steve&#39;s Minecraft Maid Skin</a>. I merged with my skins and there ya go, <a href="https://namemc.com/skin/e7b5a479a30d8e23">Maid N.</a></p>
